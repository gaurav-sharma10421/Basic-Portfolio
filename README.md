# Basic-Portfolio
This is a basic portfolio website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Itâ€™s a simple, static layout designed primarily as a learning project to strengthen my frontend fundamentals and serve as a foundation for my backend development journey.<br>

Key Aspects<br>
1.Static Layout: This portfolio has a straightforward, non-responsive design.<br>
2.Learning-Oriented: Built to deepen my understanding of frontend development concepts as I transition into backend development.<br>
